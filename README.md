**Register No.:** 212222230165  
**Course:** PE  
**Experiment Title:** Exploring Prompting Techniques for AI Video Generation

## Aim

To explore and understand the various prompting techniques used for generating videos using AI-powered video generation models and platforms.


## Algorithm / Procedure

1. **Familiarize with AI Video Generation Models**
   - Explored and studied popular AI-based video generation tools:
     - **Runway Gen-2** – Realistic videos from text prompts.
     - **Synthesia** – AI avatar and presenter-based generation.
     - **Pictory** – Summarizes long-form content into short videos.
     - **DeepBrain** – Corporate-style AI avatar videos.
   - Analyzed each tool for:
     - Video quality
     - Duration
     - Realism
     - Customization capabilities

2. **Create Simple Prompts for Initial Video Generation**
   - Example Prompt: `"A person walking in a park."`

3. **Use Detailed Prompts for Enhanced Visual Quality**
   - Example Prompt: `"A person in a vibrant red jacket strolls down a sunlit park path, surrounded by blooming trees and golden light.
Birds soar gracefully across the clear blue sky, casting fleeting shadows on the ground below.
A joyful dog runs alongside, weaving playfully through the grass with its tongue out and tail wagging."

4. **Add Time and Motion Elements**
   - Example Prompt: `"A mesmerizing time-lapse of the sun dipping below the ocean horizon, painting the sky in shades of orange, pink, and violet.
Gentle waves roll onto the sandy shore, catching the fading light as reflections shimmer across the water.
The camera gradually zooms out from the beach, revealing the vast seascape and the tranquil transition from day to dusk."`

5. **Iterate and Refine Prompts**
   - Initial Prompt: `"A car racing through a city at night."`
   - Refined Prompt: `"A sleek car races through a neon-drenched cityscape at night, lights streaking across its polished surface in a blur of motion.
Reflections ripple across the rain-soaked streets, mirroring towering skyscrapers and glowing billboards.
The scene intensifies into a high-speed chase, with sharp turns, screeching tires, and pulsating synth music heightening the adrenaline."`

6. **Generate Multiple Variations**
   - Created versions with varying:
     - Camera angles
     - Weather conditions
     - Character clothing

7. **Save and Compare Outputs**
   - Saved each generated video
   - Compared effects of prompt:
     - Structure
     - Tone
     - Detail


## Result

The experiment was successfully executed. It was observed that detailed, structured, and context-rich prompts significantly improved the realism, aesthetic quality, and expressive capacity of AI-generated videos.
